# movie-recommendation
This project builds a movie recommendation system that suggests movies based on a user's input movie. The system analyzes movie preferences and suggests similar movies using collaborative filtering or content-based algorithms.

Tools Used:

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Scikit-learn

Vectorizer

Features

User Input: User provides a movie title.

Recommendation: System suggests similar movies based on input.

Collaborative/Content-based Filtering: Uses collaborative filtering or content-based methods to find similar movies.

Steps

Data Collection: Use a dataset (e.g., MovieLens) containing movie details and ratings.

Preprocessing: Clean the dataset and transform it into a usable format for the model.

Model Building: Implement collaborative filtering or content-based filtering to suggest movies.

User Interaction: Get movie input from the user and display movie recommendations.

How to Run

Clone the repository or open it in your IDE.

Install the necessary libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn).

Run the script to input a movie and get recommendations.
